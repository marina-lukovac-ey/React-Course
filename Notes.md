## WHAT IS REACT?

---

> Client-side JS library used to create user interfaces...
> DOM Manipulations...

### ReactJS Alternatives Vue, Angular

Angular: Complete component-based UI FRAMEWORK, packed with features. Uses Typescript. Can be overkill for smaller projects.
React: Lean and focused component-based UI LIBRARY. Certain features (e.g. routing) are added via community packages
Vue: Complete component-based FRAMEWORK, includes most core features. A bit less popular than React & Angular.
